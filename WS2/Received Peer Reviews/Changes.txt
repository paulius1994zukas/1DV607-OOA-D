Suggested by Peer reviews:
Put classes in different namespaces (model, view, controller)

Create sequence diagram that shows output list use case.
Edit class diagram and sequance diagrams to show new namespaces.
See if theres anything I can do regarding the boat part of the sequence diagram.
Make add boat and show list a sub diagram of general flow diagram
Check if Controller really need to be dependant on Member?
Add some data and save to file. Which is provided and add instructions for how to use it in readme.

Added by me:
