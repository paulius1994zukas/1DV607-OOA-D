Comments on the model:
-From the model it seems the secretary is managing the actual member. I'd say he's managing the records of a member somewhere in their paperwork. The same could also be true for Secretary's association with boat and berth.
-Parts of it are unclear due to missing UML notation, see below.

UML notation:
-Map is missing multiplicity indicators on most associations, see Larman [1, Chap 9 section 14] F.ex. how many secretaries assign how many berth?
-Map is missing attributes (doesnt mean they are needed but could be). see Larman [1, Chap 9 section 16]

General comments:
Has good names for classes and has the most important classes. I think it needs to be more detailed and go "deeper" into the domain to get a good understanding of the domain and to be useful. I.e. add more classes and UML notation.
